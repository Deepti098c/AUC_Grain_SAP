# AUC_Grain_SAP

Purpose
This script generates multiclass ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves for evaluating the performance of a classification model that predicts grain color categories (e.g., red, brown, white, yellow). It uses the one-vs-rest approach and calculates the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for each class, visualized with distinct colors using ggplot2.
